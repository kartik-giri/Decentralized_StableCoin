# My Learnings:

5.Contract Deployment.
6.Fuzz testing.
7.Invariant testing.


# Features:
1. Exogeneous Collateralization: Our stablecoin is backed by external assets, ensuring a robust and reliable peg to the desired value.
2. Smart Contract Security: Built on a foundation of secure smart contracts, prioritizes the safety of user funds and ensures trustless transactions.

# How It Works:
1. Collateralization: Users lock exogeneous assets into the protocol to mint stablecoins.
2. Peg Maintenance: Smart contracts autonomously manage the collateral, adjusting ratios to maintain the stablecoin's peg.
